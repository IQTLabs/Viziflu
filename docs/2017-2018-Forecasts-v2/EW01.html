            <p>* This visualization displays forecasts submitted to the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov" rel="nofollow">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a> as part of the <a href="https://predict.cdc.gov/" rel="nofollow">FluSight</a> influenza forecasting challenge for the 2017-2018 flu season. Multiple outside research teams have developed different models that provide flu activity forecasts to CDC, and more information and visualizations of forecasts can be found on the FluSight <a href="https://predict.cdc.gov/post/5ba1504e5619f003acb7e18f" rel="nofollow">website</a> and <a href="https://github.com/cdcepi/FluSight-forecasts" rel="nofollow">GitHub repo</a>. Peak week, the primary variable shown above, is the week with the highest percentage of outpatient visits for influenza-like illness (i.e. the week of the season when flu activity is the greatest). More precisely, it is defined as the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/index.html" rel="nofollow">MMWR</a> surveillance week in which the weighted <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/overview.htm#anchor_1539281266932/"rel="nofollow">ILINet</a> percentage, rounded to one decimal place, is the highest for the influenza season. Accurate and timely forecasts for the peak week can be useful for planning and promoting activities to increase influenza vaccination prior to the bulk of influenza illness. For healthcare, pharmacy, and public health authorities, a forecast for the peak week can guide efficient staff and resource allocation. To that end, this tool is being provided as a resource for interpreting and visualizing forecasts.</p>
